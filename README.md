# PowerShell Scripts Collection

This repository contains PowerShell scripts that I find useful.

## `get-calendar-meetings-info.ps1`

This script collects statistics about user calendar meetings, including:

- What meetings were scheduled
- Who was the organizer and who were the participants
- Whether there were any attachments in the meeting invites
- Whether the meeting contained a description beyond the default placeholder generated by Skype for Business
- Additionally, for future enhancements, the script retrieves the meeting ID generated when scheduling through Skype for Business (SfB)

### Requirements
- The script must be run from the **Exchange Management Shell**.
- Since the script uses EWS, the executing user must have either:
  - Explicit permissions to the target mailboxes (which the script checks), **or**
  - The **Impersonation** role assigned  
  A reminder on how to assign the Impersonation role is provided at the beginning of the script.

### Input

- The list of users to analyze must be provided in a file named `users.txt`, using a simple line-by-line format.
